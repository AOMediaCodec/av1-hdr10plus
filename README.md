# av1-hdr10plus

This is the official AOM repository for the development of the specification for the use of AV1 and HDR10+.

# Specification development
This specification is written using [Bikeshed](https://tabatkins.github.io/bikeshed/).

The main file is called index.bs.

The file index.html is produced when Bikeshed processes the index.bs file.

If you have modifications to make (e.g. in pull requests), change the index.bs file. Then, run Bikeshed to produce the HTML file. Bikeshed can be run locally on your machine or invoked remotely. See Bikeshed's documentation for more details.
